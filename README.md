# Fund Me Project

This project is part of Web3 dev Tutrial made by Patrick Collins available in FreeCodeCamp Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=43528s

It demonstrates how to create a basic decentrilised crowdfunding project using:

Smart Contract: Solidity,
Compile, test, deploy: hardhat

In addition, it uses some useful plugins such "hardhat-deploy", "hardhat-etherscan" for contract verification and "solidity-coverage" to insure that tests cover all the solidity code.
